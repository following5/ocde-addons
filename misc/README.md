**dbsv-update.php**

The database mutation 165 contains an unusual combination of non-ASCII characters,
which can make your editor detect the file as ISO-8859-1 and thus destroy the
character encoding. We keep a copy of `dbsv-update.php` here with an UTF-8 mark
in the header, which will prevent problems.
